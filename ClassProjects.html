            <p>Welcome to the class projects page! In here, you will find a few larger projects and assignments
                I have worked on during ICS3U. They are all listed below with some reflections and comments 
                regarding the difficulty, enjoyment and other obstacles resulting from the assignments.

                <strong>Monty Hall Assignment (Extra Credit)</strong><br>
                Here is an extra credit assignment that I completed throughout the JavaScript Unit. It relates to the show where
                a contestand must pick the right door to win a car, otherwise they get a goat. The code was not too complex, but it
                definately took me some problem solving and commitment.

                <strong>Languages of the World</strong><br>
                Here is an assignment where I had to team up with a partner to create a poster about the computer language
                of JavaScript. We covered the history, the uses, importance, comparisons, etc... This was a decent project 
                and was great to learn about various languages.

                <strong>History of Computers Website (HOC)</strong><br>
                Here is an assignment were we had to create a website based on a historical figure who contributed to computers.
                I got to create a website based on the inventor of the first digital computer. It was a pretty rewarding project when
                I finished.

                <strong>Careers In ICS</strong><br>
                In this assignment, I created a video of myself talking about the opportunities of the careers in sales and marketing. I discussed
                how they relate to ICS and how these careers utilize technology to fit into the modern world and excel. This was a very enjoyable
                project to work on as I am very interested in business.
