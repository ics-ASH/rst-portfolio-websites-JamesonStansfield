        <strong>Jameson's Portfolio:</strong><br>
        Welcome to my ICS3U portfolio. Here, you can find
        my weekly journal, class projects, useful 
        bookmarks, and my final project. This website is
        filled with useful recources and interesting events
        that iccured throughout the course. The weekly journal 
        is organized from least recent at the top to latest at 
        the bottom. To go to the bookmarked sites in the bookmarks page, 
        simply click on the icon of the bookmark and it will 
        take you to a new page. Enjoy!

  <div class="introbox"><p class="paragraph"><strong>Javascript Unit Work Showcase:</strong><br>
    The images below show the completion of the first three JavaScript units. There are 
    different tasks ranging from basic user input, to funcitons and nested loops. <br><strong>Unit 1</strong> is the first image displayed below. 
    It contains many smaller tasks covering the basics of JavaScript, creating a great baseline for the rest of out learning. <br>
    <strong>Unit 2</strong> is the second image displayed, the smaller of the units but a very important one. This is where we learnt about functions 
    and returns, topics we would continue to use non-stop later on. Unit 2 was a very crutial to understand to continue on to Unit 3 and 
    beyond. <br><strong>Unit 3</strong> is the final image to the right of the page. This is where the most challenges were and the best where I have 
    preformed. We learnt about many different topics and I coded so much. In this unit, I sped through so fast and learnt so much in 
    so little time. In fact, I was ahead of the class by a few days.

    <div class="gall-text"><p>Here are 3 screenshots of my repository work. Feel free to take a look. All of them are 
      completed to my strong ability. I have worked hard in completing these tasks and assignments. There are various
      lines of code about simple topics like strings and loops, user input, conditions, to arrays and complicated 
      nesting.
