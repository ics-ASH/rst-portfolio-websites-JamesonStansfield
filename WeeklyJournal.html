        <p><strong>02/26/24 - 03/01/24</strong><br>This week, we began
        coding inside of "gocobi". We begun powering
        through the lessons of html, css, and javascript.
        Midweek, the CSE group came and we began setting
        up our accounts and using the terminal with our 
        rasberry pis. To end off the week, we wrapped up
        the javascript lessons on cobi. This week, I
        learned a good amount of Javascript and sharpened
        my practice with html and css.</p>

        <p><strong>03/04/24 - 03/08/24</strong><br>This week, 
        we began our History of Computers (HOC) assignment. the 
        task was to research a figure from Mr. Jamiesons list and create
        a website on them, their story, and their acheivments. We worked
        on this for the first two days and on wednsday we did CSE. On 
        thursday, we presented our computer language posters and Destin and 
        Destin and I presented out Javascript poster. We ended off the 
        week on friday, catching up on work and some of us playing minecraft.</p>

        <p><strong>04/08/24 - 04/12/24</strong><br>During this week, we began
        working on a new project called the Careers Progect. This was all about 
        looking at different careers in ICT that we were interesed in. We had 
        to present our projects to Mr. Jamieson through a creative format. I chose
        to make a basic website hub that contained my citations for my research, 
        and my video that I recorded. The video went into detail on the points that
        I had to talk about for my career option, which was Sales & Marketing. We 
        continued through the week by doing CSE on wednsday. We started to code 
        more intermediate programs with the lights of the rasberry pi's. Then 
        to end off the week, we finished up our careers project and did a unit 
        acessment quiz.</p>

        <p><strong>04/15/24 - 04/19/24</strong><br>This week, we reviewed our
        unit 1 content and set up our raspberry pi code onto our laptops. This 
        made it accessible to work on our cse projects in visual studio code. We
        also did our quiz on thursday which we were required to create a program
        and it went quite well. Lasty, on friday we began working on our new unit,
        2.1 with functions.</p>

        <p><strong>05/13/24 - 05/17/24</strong><br>This week, the class continued
        to work on unit 3 work. On the other hand, I worked on my website and other
        extra tasks. We did that and then did some Raspberry Pi messing around on 
        Wednsday like usual. On Thursday and Friday we were supposed to be doing 
        a summative task, except it was postponed. Instead, I have been working away
        at improving my website and trying my best to incorperate more styling and 
        most importantly, adding in more JavaScript for functionality.</p>

        <p><strong>05/20/24 - 05/24/24</strong><br>This was a short week with Victoria
        Day on monday. This week, we worked hard on our presentations for Unit 3. Our
        task was to create a lesson about while loops and present it to the class as if
        it was an audience of new programmers. Work went quite well.</p>
